2. Create a branch. This will let you have your own version of the repository while preserving the class notes I do. Name the branch your last name.

3. Create a new file with which to take notes. We'll be taking notes in Markdown, (this README itself was made in Markdown) because it allows us to use HTML in our notes and format code better than something like Google Docs.

4. Name the file **unit1.md** and take your notes. You can learn more about taking notes in Markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Notice that there is a **Preview** tab where you can see what your notes will look like.
